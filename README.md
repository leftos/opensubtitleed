# opensubtitleed
Open Subtitle Editor

Re-release of 2009-10 project originally hosted on SourceForge.  
I decided to auto-convert the old source code to C#, fix a couple of decade-old crash bugs, and re-release under the MIT license.  
This comes with no promises that I'm going to make any further bug-fixes or feature additions to this project.  
It deserves a full re-write in C# & WPF, but for now the auto-converted code from VB.NET to C# will do.

I no longer have access to the SourceForge project or the website, and can't update them.
